Currently there is 1 preset: centered guns.
It does what it says, which is center weapons.
It only centers weapons that make sense, so a few weapons still have the default positions:
	•Food and drink items
	•Throwables like the jarate and mad milk
	•The huntsman
	•All melee weapons 
	•Inspects are still in the default position
There are a couple caveats:
	•It's made with minimal viewmodels in mind, so make sure to have that on (tf_use_min_viewmodels 1). Fov shouldn't matter.
	•There is a normal tf2 bug with minimal viewmodels:
		The stock shotgun, if strange or has a skin, has a different offset from all the other shotguns or a non-strange non-skinned one
		This preset is made for a normal stock shotgun
		If you use a strange/skinned shotgun, you can manually go in the settings and change the X_position closer to 0 (if it's -10, try something like -6/-7)
To use the preset just go in the folder, copy the settings files and paste them in the main folder.
