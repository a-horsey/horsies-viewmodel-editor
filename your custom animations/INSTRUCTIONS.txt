	This program (partially) supports custom viewmodel animations.
	It automatically checks if the mod is compatible and installs it.
	Incompatible mods will be automatically deleted from this folder.

How to install custom animations:
	1. Download any viewmodel animations you wish to use
	2. Place the VPKs in this folder ("your custom animations"). Currently only supports VPKs and not loose files.
	3. Run GENERATE.bat again and install

How to uninstall a mod:
	1. Remove its VPK from this folder
	2. Run GENERATE.bat again and install
	
WARNING: even if a mod passes the check and installs properly, there's no guarantee that it will work without issues.
	It is possible that some settings might not work as intended for some mods, or some other issues could show up.
