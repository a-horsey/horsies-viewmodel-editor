For example, you could change the main window's title bar from "Crowbar" to "Crowbar Modified by YourName" 
and add in a box in About window showing "Modified by: YourName".

Or rename your version to something completely different
and simply credit ZeqMacaw for providing source code that your modified version is based on.
